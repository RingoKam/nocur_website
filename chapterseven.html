                Chapter 7. Cellular Automata
            </h2>
            <h3>“To play life you must have a fairly large checkerboard and a plentiful supply of flat counters of two
                colors. It is possible to work with pencil and graph paper but it is much easier, particularly for
                beginners, to use counters and a board.”

                <p></p>
                — Martin Gardner, Scientific American (October 1970)
            </h3>
            <p>In this chapter, we’re going to take a break from talking about vectors and motion. In fact, the rest of
                the book will mostly focus on systems and algorithms (albeit ones that we can, should, and will apply to
                moving bodies). In the previous chapter, we encountered our first Processing example of a complex
                system: flocking. We briefly stated the core principles behind complex systems: more than the sum of its
                parts, a complex system is a system of elements, operating in parallel, with short-range relationships
                that as a whole exhibit emergent behavior. This entire chapter is going to be dedicated to building
                another complex system simulation in Processing. Oddly, we are going to take some steps backward and
                simplify the elements of our system. No longer are the individual elements going to be members of a
                physics world; instead we will build a system out of the simplest digital element possible, a single
                bit. This bit is going to be called a cell and its value (0 or 1) will be called its state. Working with
                such simple elements will help us understand more of the details behind how complex systems work, and
                we’ll also be able to elaborate on some programming techniques that we can apply to code-based projects.

            <h2>
                7.1 What Is a Cellular Automaton?
            </h2>
            <p>First, let’s get one thing straight. The term cellular automata is plural. Our code examples will
                simulate just one—a cellular automaton, singular. To simplify our lives, we’ll also refer to cellular
                automata as “CA.”</p>
            <p>In Chapters 1 through 6, our objects (mover, particle, vehicle, boid) generally existed in only one
                “state.” They might have moved around with advanced behaviors and physics, but ultimately they remained
                the same type of object over the course of their digital lifetime. We’ve alluded to the possibility that
                these entities can change over time (for example, the weights of steering “desires” can vary), but we
                haven’t fully put this into practice. In this context, cellular automata make a great first step in
                building a system of many objects that have varying states over time.</p>
            <p>A cellular automaton is a model of a system of “cell” objects with the following characteristics.</p>
            <p>The cells live on a grid. (We’ll see examples in both one and two dimensions in this chapter, though a
                cellular automaton can exist in any finite number of dimensions.)</p>
            <p>Each cell has a state. The number of state possibilities is typically finite. The simplest example has
                the two possibilities of 1 and 0 (otherwise referred to as “on” and “off” or “alive” and “dead”).</p>
            <p>Each cell has a neighborhood. This can be defined in any number of ways, but it is typically a list of
                adjacent cells.</p>

                Figure 7.1
            </p>
            <p>The development of cellular automata systems is typically attributed to Stanisław Ulam and John von
                Neumann, who were both researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico in the 1940s.
                Ulam was studying the growth of crystals and von Neumann was imagining a world of self-replicating
                robots. That’s right, robots that build copies of themselves. Once we see some examples of CA
                visualized, it’ll be clear how one might imagine modeling crystal growth; the robots idea is perhaps
                less obvious. Consider the design of a robot as a pattern on a grid of cells (think of filling in some
                squares on a piece of graph paper). Now consider a set of simple rules that would allow that pattern to
                create copies of itself on that grid. This is essentially the process of a CA that exhibits behavior
                similar to biological reproduction and evolution. (Incidentally, von Neumann’s cells had twenty-nine
                possible states.) Von Neumann’s work in self-replication and CA is conceptually similar to what is
                probably the most famous cellular automaton: the “Game of Life,” which we will discuss in detail in
                section 7.3.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the most significant scientific (and lengthy) work studying cellular automata arrived in 2002:
                Stephen Wolfram’s 1,280-page A New Kind of Science. Available in its entirety for free online, Wolfram’s
                book discusses how CA are not simply neat tricks, but are relevant to the study of biology, chemistry,
                physics, and all branches of science. This chapter will barely scratch the surface of the theories
                Wolfram outlines (we will focus on the code implementation) so if the examples provided spark your
                curiosity, you’ll find plenty more to read about in his book.</p>
            <h2>
                7.2 Elementary Cellular Automata </h2>
            <p>The examples in this chapter will begin with a simulation of Wolfram’s work. To understand Wolfram’s
                elementary CA, we should ask ourselves the question: “What is the simplest cellular automaton we can
                imagine?” What’s exciting about this question and its answer is that even with the simplest CA
                imaginable, we will see the properties of complex systems at work.</p>
            <p>Let’s build Wolfram’s elementary CA from scratch. Concepts first, then code. What are the three key
                elements of a CA?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Grid. The simplest grid would be one-dimensional: a line of cells.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="https://natureofcode.com/book/imgs/chapter07/ch07_02.png" style="  width: 100%;
height: 100%;" alt="Figure 7.2">
            <p>
                Figure 7.2
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>States. The simplest set of states (beyond having only one state) would be two states: 0 or 1.

                </li>
            </ul>
            <img src="https://natureofcode.com/book/imgs/chapter07/ch07_03.png" style="  width: 100%;
height: 100%;" alt="Figure 7.3">
            <p>
                Figure 7.3
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Neighborhood. The simplest neighborhood in one dimension for any given cell would be the cell itself
                    and its two adjacent neighbors: one to the left and one to the right.

                </li>
            </ul>
            <img src="https://natureofcode.com/book/imgs/chapter07/ch07_04.png" style="  width: 100%;
                height: 100%;" alt="Figure 7.4">
            <p>
                Figure 7.4
            </p>
            <p>So we begin with a line of cells, each with an initial state (let’s say it is random), and each with two
                neighbors. We’ll have to figure out what we want to do with the cells on the edges (since those have
                only one neighbor each), but this is something we can sort out later.</p>
            <img src="https://natureofcode.com/book/imgs/chapter07/ch07_05.png" style="  width: 100%;
                                height: 100%;" alt="Figure 7.5">
            <p>
                Figure 7.5
            </p>
            <p>We haven’t yet discussed, however, what is perhaps the most important detail of how cellular automata
                work—time. We’re not really talking about real-world time here, but about the CA living over a period of
                time, which could also be called a generation and, in our case, will likely refer to the frame count of
                an animation. The figures above show us the CA at time equals 0 or generation 0. The questions we have
                to ask ourselves are: How do we compute the states for all cells at generation 1? And generation 2? And
                so on and so forth.</p>

            <img src="https://natureofcode.com/book/imgs/chapter07/ch07_06.png" style="  width: 100%;
                                    height: 100%;" alt="Figure 7.6">
            <p>
                Figure 7.6
            </p>
            <p>Let’s say we have an individual cell in the CA, and let’s call it CELL. The formula for calculating
                CELL’s state at any given time t is as follows:</p>
            <p> CELL state at time t = f(CELL neighborhood at time t - 1)</p>

            <img src="https://natureofcode.com/book/imgs/chapter07/ch07_07.png" style="  width: 100%;
             height: 100%;" alt="Figure 7.7">
            <p>
                Figure 7.7
            </p>
            <p>Now, in the world of cellular automata, there are many ways we could compute a cell’s state from a group
                of cells. Consider blurring an image. (Guess what? Image Unity works with CA-like rules.) A pixel’s new
                state (i.e. its color) is the average of all of its neighbors’ colors. We could also say that a cell’s
                new state is the sum of all of its neighbors’ states. With Wolfram’s elementary CA, however, we can
                actually do something a bit simpler and seemingly absurd: We can look at all the possible configurations
                of a cell and its neighbor and define the state outcome for every possible configuration. It seems
                ridiculous—wouldn’t there be way too many possibilities for this to be practical? Let’s give it a try.
            </p>
            <p>We have three cells, each with a state of 0 or 1. How many possible ways can we configure the states? If
                you love binary, you’ll notice that three cells define a 3-bit number, and how high can you count with 3
                bits? Up to 8. Let’s have a look.</p>
            <img src="https://natureofcode.com/book/imgs/chapter07/ch07_08.png" style="  width: 100%;
height: 100%;" alt="Figure 7.8">
            <p>
                Figure 7.8
            </p>
            <p>Once we have defined all the possible neighborhoods, we need to define an outcome (new state value: 0 or
                1) for each neighborhood configuration.</p>
            <img src="https://natureofcode.com/book/imgs/chapter07/ch07_09.png" style="  width: 100%;
height: 100%;" alt="Figure 7.9">
            <p>
                Figure 7.9
            </p>
            <p>The standard Wolfram model is to start generation 0 with all cells having a state of 0 except for the
                middle cell, which should have a state of 1.</p>
            <img src="https://natureofcode.com/book/imgs/chapter07/ch07_10.png" style="  width: 100%;
height: 100%;" alt="Figure 7.10">
            <p>
                Figure 7.10
            </p>
            <p>Referring to the ruleset above, let’s see how a given cell (we’ll pick the center one) would change from
                generation 0 to generation 1.</p>
            <img src="https://natureofcode.com/book/imgs/chapter07/ch07_11.png" style="  width: 100%;

                Figure 7.11
            </p>
            <p>Try applying the same logic to all of the cells above and fill in the empty cells.</p>
            <p>Now, let’s go past just one generation and color the cells —0 means white, 1 means black—and stack the
                generations, with each new generation appearing below the previous one.</p>
            <img src="https://natureofcode.com/book/imgs/chapter07/ch07_12.png" style="  width: 100%;

            <p>
                Figure 7.12: Rule 90
            </p>
            <p>The low-resolution shape we’re seeing above is the “Sierpiński triangle.” Named after the Polish
                mathematician Wacław Sierpiński, it’s a fractal pattern that we’ll examine in the next chapter. That’s
                right: this incredibly simple system of 0s and 1s, with little neighborhoods of three cells, can
                generate a shape as sophisticated and detailed as the Sierpiński triangle. Let’s look at it again, only
                with each cell a single pixel wide so that the resolution is much higher.</p>
            <p>Now, let’s go past just one generation and color the cells —0 means white, 1 means black—and stack the
                generations, with each new generation appearing below the previous one.</p>

                Figure 7.13: Rule 90
            </p>
            <p>This particular result didn’t happen by accident. I picked this set of rules because of the pattern it
                generates. Take a look at Figure 7.8 one more time. Notice how there are eight possible neighborhood
                configurations; we therefore define a “ruleset” as a list of 8 bits.</p>
            <p>So this particular rule can be illustrated as follows:</p>

            <p>
                Figure 7.14: Rule 90
            </p>
            <p>Eight 0s and 1s means an 8-bit number. How many combinations of eight 0s and 1s are there? 256. This is
                just like how we define the components of an RGB color. We get 8 bits for red, green, and blue, meaning
                we make colors with values from 0 to 255 (256 possibilities).</p>
            <p>In terms of a Wolfram elementary CA, we have now discovered that there are 256 possible rulesets. The
                above ruleset is commonly referred to as “Rule 90” because if you convert the binary
                sequence—01011010—to a decimal number, you’ll get the integer 90. Let’s try looking at the results of
                another ruleset.</p>

            <p>As we can now see, the simple act of creating a CA and defining a ruleset does not guarantee visually
                interesting results. Out of all 256 rulesets, only a handful produce compelling outcomes. However, it’s
                quite incredible that even one of these rulesets for a one-dimensional CA with only two possible states
                can produce the patterns we see every day in nature (see Figure 7.16), and it demonstrates how valuable
                these systems can be in simulation and pattern generation.</p>
            <p>Before we go too far down the road of how Wolfram classifies the results of varying rulesets, let’s look
                at how we actually build a Unity scene that generates the Wolfram CA and visualizes it onscreen.</p>
            <h2>
                7.3 How to Program an Elementary CA
            </h2>
            <p>You may be thinking: “OK, I’ve got this cell thing. And the cell thing has some properties, like a state,
                what generation it’s on, who its neighbors are, where it lives pixel-wise on the screen. And maybe it
                has some functions: it can display itself, it can generate its new state, etc.” This line of thinking is
                an excellent one and would likely lead you to write some code like this:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">

    public class Cell
    {

    }
    </pre>
            <p>This line of thinking, however, is not the road we will first travel. Later in this chapter, we will
                discuss why an object-oriented approach could prove valuable in developing a CA simulation, but to
                begin, we can work with a more elementary data structure. After all, what is an elementary CA but a list
                of 0s and 1s? Certainly, we could describe the following CA generation using an array:</p>

    </pre>
            <p>
                To draw that array, we simply check if we’ve got a 0 or a 1 and create a fill accordingly.

            <p>Now that we have the array to describe the cell states of a given generation (which we’ll ultimately
                consider the “current” generation), we need a mechanism by which to compute the next generation. Let’s
                think about the pseudocode of what we are doing at the moment.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>For every cell in the array:</li>
                <li>Take a look at the neighborhood states: left, middle, right.</li>
                <li>Look up the new value for the cell state according to some ruleset.</li>
                <li>Set the cell’s state to that new value.</li>
                <li>This may lead you to write some code like this:</li>
            </ul>
<pre class="prettyprint">

    public void Generate()
    {
        // First we create an empty array for the new values
        int[] nextGen = new int[cells.Length];

        // For every spot, determine new state by examing current state, and neighbor states
        // Ignore edges that only have one neighor
        for (int i = 1; i < cells.Length; i++)
        {
            int left = cells[i - 1]; // Left neighbor state
            int me = cells[i]; // Current state
            int right = cells[i + 1]; // Right neighbor state
            nextGen[i] = rules(left, me, right); // Compute next generation state based on ruleset
        }

        // The current generation is the new generation
        cells = nextGen;
        generation++;
    }
    </pre>
            <p>We’re fairly close to getting this right, but we’ve made one minor blunder and one major blunder in the
                above code. Let’s talk about what we’ve done well so far.</p>
            <p>Notice how easy it is to look at a cell’s neighbors. Because an array is an ordered list of data, we can
                use the fact that the indices are numbered to know which cells are next to which cells. We know that
                cell number 15, for example, has cell 14 to its left and 16 to its right. More generally, we can say
                that for any cell i, its neighbors are i-1 and i+1.</p>
            <p>We’re also farming out the calculation of a new state value to some function called rules(). Obviously,
                we’re going to have to write this function ourselves, but the point we’re making here is modularity. We
                have a basic framework for the CA in this function, and if we later want to change how the rules
                operate, we don’t have to touch that framework; we can simply rewrite the rules() function to compute
                the new states differently.</p>
            <p>So what have we done wrong? Let’s talk through how the code will execute. First, we look at cell index i
                equals 0. Now let’s look at 0’s neighbors. Left is index -1. Middle is index 0. And right is index 1.
                However, our array by definition does not have an element with the index -1. It starts with 0. This is a
                problem we’ve alluded to before: the edge cases.</p>
            <p>How do we deal with the cells on the edge who don’t have a neighbor to both their left and their right?
                Here are three possible solutions to this problem:</p>
            <p>Edges remain constant. This is perhaps the simplest solution. We never bother to evaluate the edges and
                always leave their state value constant (0 or 1).</p>
            <p>Edges wrap around. Think of the CA as a strip of paper and turn that strip of paper into a ring. The cell
                on the left edge is a neighbor of the cell on the right and vice versa. This can create the appearance
                of an infinite grid and is probably the most used solution.</p>
            <p>Edges have different neighborhoods and rules. If we wanted to, we could treat the edge cells differently
                and create rules for cells that have a neighborhood of two instead of three. You may want to do this in
                some circumstances, but in our case, it’s going to be a lot of extra lines of code for little benefit.
            </p>
            <p>To make the code easiest to read and understand right now, we’ll go with option #1 and just skip the edge
                cases, leaving their values constant. This can be accomplished by starting the loop one cell later and
                ending one cell earlier:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">

    public void Generate()
    {
        // First we create an empty array for the new values
        int[] nextGen = new int[cells.Length];

        // For every spot, determine new state by examing current state, and neighbor states
        // Ignore edges that only have one neighor
        for (int i = 1; i < cells.Length-1; i++)
        {
            int left = cells[i - 1]; // Left neighbor state
            int me = cells[i]; // Current state
            int right = cells[i + 1]; // Right neighbor state
            nextGen[i] = rules(left, me, right); // Compute next generation state based on ruleset
        }

        // The current generation is the new generation
        cells = nextGen;
        generation++;
    }
    </pre>
            <p>We’re almost done. The above code is complete except for the fact that we haven’t yet written the rules()
                function that computes the new state value based on the neighborhood (left, middle, and right cells). We
                know that function needs to return an integer (0 or 1) as well as receive three arguments (for the three
                neighbors).</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">

    private int rules (int a, int b, int c)
    {
    </pre>
            <p>Now, there are many ways we could write this function, but I’d like to start with a long-winded one that
                will hopefully provide a clear illustration of what we are doing.</p>
            <p>Let’s first establish how we are storing the ruleset. The ruleset, if you remember from the previous
                section, is a series of 8 bits (0 or 1) that defines that outcome for every possible neighborhood
                configuration.</p>

            <p>
                Figure 7.14 Repeated
            </p>
            <p>We can store this ruleset in Unity as an array.</p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">

    public int[] ruleSet0 = { 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0 };

</pre>
            <p>And then say...</p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">

    if (a == 1 && b == 1 && c == 1) return ruleset[0];


</pre>
            <p>If left, middle, and right all have the state 1, then that matches the configuration 111 and the new
                state should be equal to the first value in the ruleset array. We can now duplicate this strategy for
                all eight possibilities.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">

    private int Rules (int a, int b, int c) // Implementing the Wolfram rules
    {
        if (a == 1 && b == 1 && c == 1) return ruleset[0];
        if (a == 1 && b == 1 && c == 0) return ruleset[1];
        if (a == 1 && b == 0 && c == 1) return ruleset[2];
        if (a == 1 && b == 0 && c == 0) return ruleset[3];
        if (a == 0 && b == 1 && c == 1) return ruleset[4];
        if (a == 0 && b == 1 && c == 0) return ruleset[5];
        if (a == 0 && b == 0 && c == 1) return ruleset[6];
        if (a == 0 && b == 0 && c == 0) return ruleset[7];
        return 0;
    }
    </pre>
            <p>For this function to be valid, we have to make sure something is returned in cases where the states do
                not match one of the eight possibilities. We know this is impossible given the rest of our code, but
                Unity does not.</p>
            <p>I like having the example written as above because it describes line by line exactly what is happening
                for each neighborhood configuration. However, it’s not a great solution. After all, what if we design a
                CA that has 4 possible states (0-3) and suddenly we have 64 possible neighborhood configurations? With
                10 possible states, we have 1,000 configurations. Certainly we don’t want to type in 1,000 lines of
                code!</p>
            <p>Another solution, though perhaps a bit more difficult to follow, is to convert the neighborhood
                configuration (a 3-bit number) into a regular integer and use that value as the index into the ruleset
                array. </p>
            <p>So far in this section, we’ve written everything we need to compute the generations for a Wolfram
                elementary CA. Let’s take a moment to organize the above code into a class, which will ultimately help
                in the design of our overall scene.</p>

            <p>What’s missing? Presumably, it’s our intention to display cells and their states in visual form. As we
                saw earlier, the standard technique for doing this is to stack the generations one on top of each other

            <p>One, this visual interpretation of the data is completely literal. It’s useful for demonstrating the
                algorithms and results of Wolfram’s elementary CA, but it shouldn’t necessarily drive your own personal
                work. It’s rather unlikely that you are building a project that needs precisely this algorithm with this
                visual style. So while learning to draw the CA in this way will help you understand and implement CA
                systems, this skill should exist only as a foundation.</p>
            <p>Second, the fact that we are visualizing a one-dimensional CA with a two-dimensional image can be
                confusing. It’s very important to remember that this is not a 2D CA. We are simply choosing to show a
                history of all the generations stacked vertically. This technique creates a two-dimensional image out of
                many instances of one-dimensional data. But the system itself is one-dimensional. Later, we are going to
                look at an actual 2D CA (the Game of Life) and discuss how we might choose to display such a system.</p>
            <p>The good news is that drawing the CA is not particularly difficult. Let’s begin by looking at how we
                would render a single generation. Assume we have a Unity window 600 pixels wide and we want each cell to
                be a 10x10 square. We therefore have a CA with 60 cells. Of course, we can calculate this value
                dynamically.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">

    rowWidth = 17;
    cells = new int[cellCapacity / rowWidth];
    </pre>
            <p>In truth, we could optimize the above by having a white background and only drawing when there is a black
                cell (saving us the work of drawing many white squares), but in most cases this solution is good enough
                (and necessary for other more sophisticated designs with varying colors, etc.) Also, if we wanted each
                cell to be represented as a single pixel, we would not want to use Unity’s rect() function, but rather
                access the pixel array directly.</p>
            <p>In the above code, you’ll notice the y-location for each rectangle is 0. If we want the generations to be
                drawn next to each other, with each row of cells marking a new generation, we’ll also need to compute a
                y-location based on how many iterations of the CA we’ve executed. We could accomplish this by adding a
                “generation” variable (an integer) to our CA class and incrementing it each time through generate().
                With these additions, we can now look at the CA class with all the features for both computing and
                drawing the CA.</p>

            <h2>7.5 Wolfram Classification</h2>
            <p>Before we move on to looking at CA in two dimensions, it’s worth taking a brief look at Wolfram’s
                classification for cellular automata. As we noted earlier, the vast majority of elementary CA rulesets
                produce uninspiring results, while some result in wondrously complex patterns like those found in
                nature. Wolfram has divided up the range of outcomes into four classes:</p>
            <img src="https://natureofcode.com/book/imgs/chapter07/ch07_18.png" style="  width: 100%;
height: 100%;" alt="Figure 7.18: Rule 222">
            <p>
                Figure 7.18: Rule 222
            </p>
            <p>Class 1: Uniformity. Class 1 CAs end up, after some number of generations, with every cell constant. This
                is not terribly exciting to watch. Rule 222 (above) is a class 1 CA; if you run it for enough
                generations, every cell will eventually become and remain black.</p>
            <img src="https://natureofcode.com/book/imgs/chapter07/ch07_19.png" style="  width: 100%;
            height: 100%;" alt="Figure 7.19: Rule 190">
            <p>
                Figure 7.19: Rule 190
            </p>
            <p>Class 2: Repetition. Like class 1 CAs, class 2 CAs remain stable, but the cell states are not constant.
                Rather, they oscillate in some regular pattern back and forth from 0 to 1 to 0 to 1 and so on. In rule
                190 (above), each cell follows the sequence 11101110111011101110.</p>
            <img src="https://natureofcode.com/book/imgs/chapter07/ch07_20.png" style="  width: 100%;

            <p>
                Figure 7.20: Rule 30
            </p>
            <p>Class 3: Random. Class 3 CAs appear random and have no easily discernible pattern. In fact, rule 30
                (above) is used as a random number generator in Wolfram’s Mathematica software. Again, this is a moment
                where we can feel amazed that such a simple system with simple rules can descend into a chaotic and
                random pattern.</p>
            <img src="https://natureofcode.com/book/imgs/chapter07/ch07_21.png" style="  width: 100%;

            </p>
            <p>Class 4: Complexity. Class 4 CAs can be thought of as a mix between class 2 and class 3. One can find
                repetitive, oscillating patterns inside the CA, but where and when these patterns appear is
                unpredictable and seemingly random. Class 4 CAs exhibit the properties of complex systems that we
                described earlier in this chapter and in Chapter 6. If a class 3 CA wowed you, then a class 4 like Rule
                110 above should really blow your mind.</p>

            <h2>7.6 The Game of Life</h2>
            <p>The next step we are going to take is to move from a one-dimensional CA to a two-dimensional one. This
                will introduce some additional complexity; each cell will have a bigger neighborhood, but that will open
                up the door to a range of possible applications. After all, most of what we do in computer graphics
                lives in two dimensions, and this chapter will demonstrate how to apply CA thinking to what we draw in
                our Unity scenes.</p>
            <p>In 1970, Martin Gardner wrote an article in Scientific American that documented mathematician John
                Conway’s new “Game of Life,” describing it as “recreational” mathematics and suggesting that the reader
                get out a chessboard and some checkers and “play.” While the Game of Life has become something of a
                computational cliché (make note of the myriad projects that display the Game of Life on LEDs, screens,
                projection surfaces, etc.), it is still important for us to build it from scratch. For one, it provides
                a good opportunity to practice our skills with two-dimensional arrays, object orientation, etc. But
                perhaps more importantly, its core principles are tied directly to our core goals—simulating the natural
                world with code. Though we may want to avoid simply duplicating it without a great deal of thought or
                care, the algorithm and its technical implementation will provide us with the inspiration and foundation
                to build simulations that exhibit the characteristics and behaviors of biological systems of
                reproduction.</p>
            <p>Unlike von Neumann, who created an extraordinarily complex system of states and rules, Conway wanted to
                achieve a similar “lifelike” result with the simplest set of rules possible. Martin Gardner outlined
                Conway’s goals as follows:</p>
                <n&bsp></n>
            <p><i>“1. There should be no initial pattern for which there is a simple proof that the population can grow
                without limit. 2. There should be initial patterns that apparently do grow without limit. 3. There
                should be simple initial patterns that grow and change for a considerable period of time before coming
                to an end in three possible ways: fading away completely (from overcrowding or becoming too sparse),
                settling into a stable configuration that remains unchanged thereafter, or entering an oscillating phase
                in which they repeat an endless cycle of two or more periods.”</i></p>
            <p>—Martin Gardner, Scientific American 223 (October 1970): 120-123.</p>
            <n&bsp></n>
            <p>The above might sound a bit cryptic, but it essentially describes a Wolfram class 4 CA. The CA should be
                patterned but unpredictable over time, eventually settling into a uniform or oscillating state. In other
                words, though Conway didn’t use this terminology, it should have all those properties of a complex
                system that we keep mentioning.</p>
            <p>Let’s look at how the Game of Life works. It won’t take up too much time or space, since we’ve covered
                the basics of CA already.</p>
            <img src="https://natureofcode.com/book/imgs/chapter07/ch07_22.png" style="  width: 100%;
        height: 100%;" alt="Figure 7.22">
            <p>
                Figure 7.22
            </p>
            <p>First, instead of a line of cells, we now have a two-dimensional matrix of cells. As with the elementary
                CA, the possible states are 0 or 1. Only in this case, since we’re talking about “life," 0 means dead
                and 1 means alive.</p>
            <p>The cell’s neighborhood has also expanded. If a neighbor is an adjacent cell, a neighborhood is now nine
                cells instead of three.</p>
            <p>With three cells, we had a 3-bit number or eight possible configurations. With nine cells, we have 9
                bits, or 512 possible neighborhoods. In most cases, it would be impractical to define an outcome for
                every single possibility. The Game of Life gets around this problem by defining a set of rules according
                to general characteristics of the neighborhood. In other words, is the neighborhood overpopulated with
                life? Surrounded by death? Or just right? Here are the rules of life.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Death. If a cell is alive (state = 1) it will die (state becomes 0) under the following
                    circumstances.</li>
                <li>Overpopulation: If the cell has four or more alive neighbors, it dies.</li>
                <li>Loneliness: If the cell has one or fewer alive neighbors, it dies.</li>
                <li>Birth. If a cell is dead (state = 0) it will come to life (state becomes 1) if it has exactly three
                    alive neighbors (no more, no less).</li>
                <li>Stasis. In all other cases, the cell state does not change. To be thorough, let’s describe those
                    scenarios.</li>
                <li>Staying Alive: If a cell is alive and has exactly two or three live neighbors, it stays alive.</li>
                <li>Staying Dead: If a cell is dead and has anything other than three live neighbors, it stays dead.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Let’s look at a few examples.</p>
            <img src="https://natureofcode.com/book/imgs/chapter07/ch07_23.png" style="  width: 100%;
height: 100%;" alt="Figure 7.23">
            <p>
                Figure 7.23
            </p>
            <p>With the elementary CA, we were able to look at all the generations next to each other, stacked as rows
                in a 2D grid. With the Game of Life, however, the CA itself is in two dimensions. We could try creating
                an elaborate 3D visualization of the results and stack all the generations in a cube structure (and in
                fact, you might want to try this as an exercise). Nevertheless, the typical way the Game of Life is
                displayed is to treat each generation as a single frame in an animation. So instead of viewing all the
                generations at once, we see them one at a time, and the result resembles rapidly growing bacteria in a
                petri dish.</p>
            <p>One of the exciting aspects of the Game of Life is that there are initial patterns that yield intriguing
                results. For example, some remain static and never change.</p>
            <img src="https://natureofcode.com/book/imgs/chapter07/ch07_24.png" style="  width: 100%;

                Figure 7.24
            </p>
            <p>There are patterns that oscillate back and forth between two states.</p>

                Figure 7.25
            </p>
            <p>And there are also patterns that from generation to generation move about the grid. (It’s important to
                note that the cells themselves aren’t actually moving, although we see the appearance of motion in the
                result as the cells turn on and off.)</p>

            <p>If you are interested in these patterns, there are several good “out of the box” Game of Life
                demonstrations online that allow you to configure the CA’s initial state and watch it run at varying
                speeds. Two examples you might want to examine are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Exploring Emergence by Mitchel Resnick and Brian Silverman, Lifelong Kindergarten Group, MIT Media
                    Laboratory</li>
                <li>Conway’s Game of Life by Steven Klise (uses Unity.js!)</li>
                <li>For the example we’ll build from scratch in the next section, it will be easier to simply randomly
                    set the states for each cell.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>7.7 Programming the Game of Life</h2>
            <p>Now we just need to extend our code from the Wolfram CA to two dimensions. We used a one-dimensional
                array to store the list of cell states before, and for the Game of Life, we can use a two-dimensional
                array.</p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">

    int[,] next = new int[columns, rows];
              </pre>
            <p>And to compute the next generation, just as before, we need a fresh 2D array to write to as we analyze
                each cell’s neighborhood and calculate a new state.</p>
            <p>OK. Before we can sort out how to actually calculate the new state, we need to know how we can reference
                each cell’s neighbor. In the case of the 1D CA, this was simple: if a cell index was i, its neighbors
                were i-1 and i+1. Here each cell doesn’t have a single index, but rather a column and row index: x,y. As
                shown in Figure 7.27, we can see that its neighbors are: (x-1,y-1) (x,y-1), (x+1,y-2), (x-1,y), (x+1,y),
                (x-1,y+1), (x,y+1), and (x+1,y+1).</p>
            <p>All of the Game of Life rules operate by knowing how many neighbors are alive. So if we create a neighbor
                counter variable and increment it each time we find a neighbor with a state of 1, we’ll have the total
                of live neighbors.</p>
            <p>And again, just as with the Wolfram CA, we find ourselves in a situation where the above is a useful and
                clear way to write the code for teaching purposes, allowing us to see every step (each time we find a
                neighbor with a state of one, we increase a counter). Nevertheless, it’s a bit silly to say, “If the
                cell state equals one, add one to a counter” when we could just say, “Add the cell state to a counter.”
                After all, if the state is only a 0 or 1, the sum of all the neighbors’ states will yield the total
                number of live cells. Since the neighbors are arranged in a mini 3x3 grid, we can add them all up with
                another loop.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">

    int[,] next = new int[columns, rows];

    // Loop through every spot in our 2D array and check spots neighbors
    for (int x = 1; x < columns - 1; x++)
    {
        for (int y = 1; y < rows - 1; y++)
        {
            // Add up all the states in a 3x3 surrounding grid
            int neighbors = 0;
            for (int i = -1; i <= 1; i++)
            {
                for (int j = -1; j <= 1; j++)
                {
                    neighbors += board[x + i, y + j];
                }
            }
    }
    </pre>
            <p>Of course, we’ve made a mistake in the code above. In the Game of Life, the cell itself does not count as
                one of the neighbors. We could use a conditional to skip adding the state when both i and j equal 0, but
                another option would be to just subtract the cell state once we’ve finished the loop.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">

    neighbors -= board[x, y];
    </pre>
            <p>Finally, once we know the total number of live neighbors, we can decide what the cell’s new state should
                be according to the rules: birth, death, or stasis.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">

    // Rules of Life
    if ((board[x,y] == 1) && (neighbors < 2)) next[x,y] = 0;        // Loneliness
    else if ((board[x,y] == 1) && (neighbors > 3)) next[x,y] = 0;   // Overpopulation
    else if ((board[x,y] == 0) && (neighbors == 3)) next[x,y] = 1;  // Reproduction
    else next[x,y] = board[x,y];                                    // Stasis
    </pre>
            <p>Finally, once the next generation is calculated, we can employ the same method we used to draw the
                Wolfram CA—a square for each spot, white for off, black for on.</p>

                    you’d want to be more careful. One solution is to have only two arrays and constantly swap them,
                    writing the next set of states into whichever one isn’t the current array. Implement this particular

            <h2>7.8 Object-Oriented Cells</h2>
            <p>Over the course of the previous six chapters, we’ve slowly built examples of systems of objects with
                properties that move about the screen. And in this chapter, although we’ve been talking about a “cell”
                as if it were an object, we actually haven’t been using any object orientation in our code (other than a
                class to describe the CA system as a whole). This has worked because a cell is such an enormously simple
                object (a single bit). However, in a moment, we are going to discuss some ideas for further developing
                CA systems, many of which involve keeping track of multiple properties for each cell. For example, what
                if a cell needed to remember its last ten states? Or what if we wanted to apply some of our motion and
                physics thinking to a CA and have the cells move about the window, dynamically changing their neighbors
                from frame to frame?</p>
            <p>To accomplish any of these ideas (and more), it would be helpful to see how we might treat a cell as an
                object with multiple properties, rather than as a single 0 or 1. To show this, let’s just recreate the
                Game of Life simulation. Only instead of:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">

    private int[,] board;
    </pre>
            <p>Let's have:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">

    private Chapter7Figure3Cell[,] board;
    </pre>
            <p>where Cell is a class we will write. What are the properties of a Cell object? In our Game of Life
                example, each cell has a location and size, as well as a state.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">

    public class Chapter7Figure3Cell
    {
        // GameObject properties, to visually represent and draw our cell
        private GameObject cellRep;
        private Material cellMaterial;

        // Size of the screen in meters, or Unity units
        private Vector2 screenSize;
        private float yScreenOffset; // Cells are spawned with a small offset so they spawn in more centered
        private float xScreenOffset;

        // Location
        private float x, y;

        public int State;
    }
    </pre>
            <p>In the non-OOP version, we used a separate 2D array to keep track of the states for the current and next
                generation. By making a cell an object, however, each cell could keep track of both states. In this
                case, we’ll think of the cell as remembering its previous state (for when new states need to be
                computed).</p>
            <pre class="prettyprint">

    public int Previous;
            </pre>
            <p>This allows us to visualize more information about what the state is doing. For example, we could choose
                to color a cell differently if its state has changed. For example:</p>

                famous 1D and 2D cellular automata, it’s time to think about how you might take this foundation of code
                and build on it, developing creative applications of CAs in your own work. In this section, we’ll talk
                through some ideas for expanding the features of the CA examples. Example answers to each of these

            <p><b>5) Historical.</b> In the Game of Life object-oriented example, we used two variables to keep track of its
                    state: current and previous. What if you use an array to keep track of a cell’s state history? This
                    relates to the idea of a “complex adaptive system,” one that has the ability to adapt and change its
                    rules over time by learning from its history. We’ll see an example of this in Chapter 10: Neural
                    Networks.

                    CA with cells that have no fixed position and instead move about the screen.

                    behaviors) and its neighborhood changed from frame to frame as it moved closer to or further from
                    other boids?

                    this way: a city is a complex system of people, a person is a complex system of organs, an organ is
                    a complex system of cells, and so on and so forth.
