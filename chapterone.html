            <h2>
                Chapter 1. Vectors
            </h2>
            <h3>“Roger, Roger. What’s our vector, Victor?”<p></p>
                — Captain Oveur (Airplane)
            </h3>
            <p>This book is all about looking at the world around us and coming up with clever ways to simulate that
                world with code. Divided into three parts, the book will start by looking at basic physics—how an apple
                falls from a tree, a pendulum swings in the air, the earth revolves around the sun, etc. Absolutely
                everything contained within the first five chapters of this book requires the use of the most basic
                building block for programming motion—the vector. And so this is where we begin our story.
            </p>
            <p>Now, the word vector can mean a lot of different things. Vector is the name of a New Wave rock band
                formed in Sacramento, CA in the early 1980s. It’s the name of a breakfast cereal manufactured by
                Kellogg’s Canada. In the field of epidemiology, a vector is used to describe an organism that transmits
                infection from one host to another. In the C++ programming language, a vector (std::vector) is an
                implementation of a dynamically resizable array data structure. While all these definitions are
                interesting, they’re not what we’re looking for. What we want is called a Euclidean vector (named for
                the Greek mathematician Euclid and also known as a geometric vector). When you see the term “vector” in
                this book, you can assume it refers to a Euclidean vector, defined as an entity that has both magnitude
                and direction.</p>
            <p>A vector is typically drawn as a arrow; the direction is indicated by where the arrow is pointing, and
                the magnitude by the length of the arrow itself.
            </p>

                    is pointing). </p>

            </div>
            <br></br>
            <p>In the above illustration, the vector is drawn as an arrow from point A to point B and serves as an
                instruction for how to travel from A to B.

                1.1 Vectors, You Complete Me

            </h2>
            <p>Before we dive into more of the details about vectors, let’s look at a basic Unity example that
                demonstrates why we should care about vectors in the first place. If you’ve read any introductory
                C# textbooks or taken a class on programming with Unity (and hopefully you’ve done one of
                these things to help prepare you for this book), you probably, at one point or another, learned how to
                write a simple bouncing mover sketch.

            <p>In the above example, we have a very simple world—a blank canvas with a circular shape (a “mover”)
                traveling around. This mover has some properties, which are represented in the code as variables.
            </p>
            <div class="note">
                <p>Location -
                    x,y, and z
                    <p></p>
                    Speed -
                    xspeed, yspeed, and zpeed</p>
            </div>
            <p>
                In a more advanced sketch, we could imagine having many more variables:
            </p>
            <div class="note">
                <p>
                    Acceleration -
                    xaccelerationm, yacceleration, and zacceleration
                    <p></p>
                    Target location -
                    xtarget, ytarget, and ztarget
                    <p></p>
                    Wind -
                    xwind, ywind, and zwind
                    <p></p>
                    Friction -
                    xfriction, yfriction, and zfriction
                </p>
                <p>
            </div>
            <p>
                It’s becoming clearer that for every concept in this world (wind, location, acceleration, etc.), we’ll
                need two variables. And this is only a two-dimensional world. In a 3D world, we’ll need x, y, z, xspeed,
                yspeed, zspeed, and so on.

                Wouldn’t it be nice if we could simplify our code and use fewer variables?

                        Taking this first step in using vectors won’t allow us to do anything new. Just adding vectors
                        won’t magically make your Unity experiences simulate physics. However, they will simplify your
                        code and provide a set of functions for common mathematical operations that happen over and over
                        and over again while programming motion.

                        1.2 Vectors for Unity Programmers

                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        One way to think of a vector is the difference between two points. Consider how you might go
                        about providing instructions to walk from one point to another.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here are some vectors and possible translations:
                    </p>
                    <div id="ImageContainer">

                        <img src="https://natureofcode.com/book/imgs/chapter01/ch01_02.png" style="  width: 100%;
    height: 100%;" alt="Figure 1.2:">
                        <p>(-15, 3) - Walk fifteen steps west; turn and walk three steps north.</p>
                        <p>(3, 4) - Walk three steps east; turn and walk five steps north.</p>
                        <p>(2, -1) - Walk two steps east; turn and walk one step south.</p>

                    <br></br>

                    <p>You’ve probably done this before when programming motion. For every frame of animation (i.e. a
                        single cycle through Processing’s draw() loop), you instruct each object on the screen to move a
                        certain number of pixels horizontally and a certain number of pixels vertically.</p>

                        <img src="https://natureofcode.com/book/imgs/chapter01/ch01_03.png" style="  width: 100%;

                    <p>
                        For every frame:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        new location = velocity applied to current location
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If velocity is a vector (the difference between two points), what is location? Is it a vector
                        too? Technically, one might argue that location is not a vector, since it’s not describing how
                        to move from one point to another—it’s simply describing a singular point in space.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nevertheless, another way to describe a location is the path taken from the origin to reach that
                        location. Hence, a location can be the vector representing the difference between location and
                        origin.

                                    the algorithm for motion—location = location + velocity. In Example 1.1, without
                                    vectors, we had:</p>

                                    <p>Before we continue looking at the PVector class and its add() method (purely for
                                        the sake of learning since it’s already implemented for us in Unity
                                        itself as Vector3), let’s examine vector addition using the notation found in math and
                                        physics textbooks.</p>
                                    <p>Vectors are typically written either in boldface type or with an arrow on top.
                                        For the purposes of this book, to distinguish a vector from a scalar (scalar
                                        refers to a single value, such as an integer or a floating point number), we’ll
                                        use the arrow notation:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Vector: u→</li>
                                        <li>Scalar: x</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Let’s say I have the following two vectors: </p>

                                        Each vector has two components, an x and a y. To add two vectors together, we
                                        simply add both x’s and both y’s.

                                    <p>In other words: </p>

                                    <p>can be written as: </p>
                                    <p>wx=ux+vx</p>
                                    <p>Then, replacing u and v with their values from Figure 1.6, we get:

                                    </p>
                                    <p>wx=5+3</p>
                                    <p>wy=2+4</p>
                                    <p>which means that: </p>
                                    <p>wx=8 wy=6</p>
                                    <p>Finally, we write that as a vector:</p>
                                    <p>w→=(8,6)</p>
                                    <p>Now that we understand how to add two vectors together, we can look at how
                                        addition is implemented in the PVector class itself. Let’s write a function
                                        called add() that takes another PVector object as its argument.

                                                    Now, you might feel somewhat disappointed. After all, this may
                                                    initially appear to have made the code more complicated than the
                                                    original version. While this is a perfectly reasonable and valid
                                                    critique, it’s important to understand that we haven’t fully
                                                    realized the power of programming with vectors just yet. Looking at
                                                    a simple bouncing mover and only implementing vector addition is just
                                                    the first step. As we move forward into a more complex world of
                                                    multiple objects and multiple forces (which we’ll introduce in
                                                    Chapter 2), the benefits of PVector will become more apparent.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    We should, however, note an important aspect of the above transition
                                                    to programming with vectors. Even though we are using PVector
                                                    objects to describe three values—the x,y, and z of location and the
                                                    x,y, and
                                                    z of velocity—we still often need to refer to the x, y, and z
                                                    components
                                                    of each PVector individually.

                                                        <p>Moving on to multiplication, we have to think a little bit
                                                            differently. When we talk about multiplying a vector, what
                                                            we typically mean is scaling a vector. If we wanted to scale
                                                            a vector to twice its size or one-third of its size (leaving
                                                            its direction the same), we would say: “Multiply the vector
                                                            by 2” or “Multiply the vector by 1/3.” Note that we are
                                                            multiplying a vector by a scalar, a single number, not
                                                            another vector.</p>
                                                        <p>To scale a vector, we multiply each component (x and y) by a

                    Because the random vector is a normalized one, we can try scaling it:

    <p>While this may seem like an obvious point, it’s crucial to understand that acceleration does not merely refer to the speeding up or slowing down of a moving object, but rather any change in velocity in either magnitude or direction. Acceleration is used to steer an object, and we’ll see this again and again in future chapters as we begin to program objects that make decisions about how to move about the screen.

            <h2>1.9 Static vs. Non-Static Functions

            </h2>
            <p>Before we get to Algorithm #3 (accelerate towards the mouse), we need to cover one more rather important aspect of working with vectors and the PVector class: the difference between using static methods and non-static methods.
<p></p>
                Forgetting about vectors for a moment, take a look at the following code:
                
                </p>
                <div class="source-code">

        float yspeed;
    
    </pre>
    </code>
    </div>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>Pretty simple, right? x has the value of 0, we add y to it, and now x is equal to 5. We could write the corresponding code pretty easily based on what we’ve learned about PVector.

    </p>
    <div class="source-code">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The vector v has the value of (0,0), we add u to it, and now v is equal to (4,5). Easy, right?
<p></p>
    Let’s take a look at another example of some simple floating point math:
        </p>
        <div class="source-code">
            <div class="code-block">
                <div class="code-comment-pair no-comment">
                    <code>
            <pre>

    float y;
    float xspeed;
    float yspeed;
    
    </pre>
    </code>
    </div>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>x has the value of 0, we add y to it, and store the result in a new variable z. The value of x does not change in this example (neither does y)! This may seem like a trivial point, and one that is quite intuitive when it comes to mathematical operations with floats. However, it’s not so obvious with mathematical operations in PVector. Let’s try to write the code based on what we know so far.

    </p>
    <div class="source-code">
        <div class="code-block">
            <div class="code-comment-pair no-comment">

float y;
float xspeed;
float yspeed;

</pre>
</code>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The above might seem like a good guess, but it’s just not the way the PVector class works. If we look at the definition of add() . . .

</code>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>we see that this code does not accomplish our goal. First, it does not return a new PVector (the return type is “void”) and second, it changes the value of the PVector upon which it is called. In order to add two PVector objects together and return the result as a new PVector, we must use the static add() function.
<p></p>

    Functions that we call from the class name itself (rather than from a speciﬁc object instance) are known as static functions. Here are two examples of function calls that assume two PVector objects, v and u:</p>


    <div class="source-code">
        <div class="code-block">
            <div class="code-comment-pair no-comment">

    float xspeed;
    float yspeed;
    
    </pre>
    </code>
    </div>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>Since you can’t write static functions yourself in Processing, you might not have encountered them before. PVector's static functions allow us to perform generic mathematical operations on PVector objects without having to adjust the value of one of the input PVectors. Let’s look at how we might write the static version of add():

    <div class="source-code">

    float yspeed;
    
    </pre>
    </code>
    </div>
    </div>
    </div>

    <p>There are several differences here:

    </p>
<ul>
    <li>The function is labeled as static.</li>
    <li>The function does not have a void return type, but rather returns a PVector.    </li>
    <li>The function creates a new PVector (v3) and returns the sum of the components of v1 and v2 in that new PVector. </li>
</ul>
<p>When you call a static function, instead of referencing an actual object instance, you simply reference the name of the class itself.

<h2>1.10 Interactivity with Acceleration</h2>
<p>To finish out this chapter, let’s try something a bit more complex and a great deal more useful. We’ll dynamically calculate an object’s acceleration according to a rule stated in Algorithm #3 — the object accelerates towards the mouse.

</p>

<div id="ImageContainer">

    <img src="https://natureofcode.com/book/imgs/chapter01/ch01_14.png" style="  width: 50%;" alt="Figure 1.14: ">
    <p>Figure 1.14    </p>
</div>
<p>Anytime we want to calculate a vector based on a rule or a formula, we need to compute two things: magnitude and direction. Let’s start with direction. We know the acceleration vector should point from the object’s location towards the mouse location. Let’s say the object is located at the point (x,y) and the mouse at (mouseX,mouseY).

</p>
<div id="ImageContainer">

    <img src="https://natureofcode.com/book/imgs/chapter01/ch01_15.png" style="  width: 50%;" alt="Figure 1.15: ">
    <p>Figure 1.15    </p>
</div>
 <p>Let’s rewrite the above using Vector3 syntax. Assuming we are in the Mover class and thus have access to the object’s Vector3 position, we then have:

</p>

<p>We now have a Vector3 that points from the mover’s location all the way to the mouse. If the object were to actually accelerate using that vector, it would appear instantaneously at the mouse location. This does not make for good animation, of course, and what we want to do now is decide how quickly that object should accelerate toward the mouse.

    To summarize, we take the following steps:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Calculate a vector that points from the object to the target location (mouse)

    </li>
    <li>Normalize that vector (reducing its length to 1)

    </li>
    <li>Scale that vector to an appropriate value (by multiplying it by some value)

    </li>
    <li>Assign that vector to acceleration

    </li>

    </ul>
    <p>And here are those steps in the update() function itself:

    You may be wondering why the circle doesn’t stop when it reaches the target. It’s important to note that the object moving has no knowledge about trying to stop at a destination; it only knows where the destination is and tries to go there as quickly as possible. Going as quickly as possible means it will inevitably overshoot the location and have to turn around, again going as quickly as possible towards the destination, overshooting it again, and so on and so forth. Stay tuned; in later chapters we’ll learn how to program an object to arrive at a location (slow down on approach).


</p>    
<p>This example is remarkably close to the concept of gravitational attraction (in which the object is attracted to the mouse location). Gravitational attraction will be covered in more detail in the next chapter. However, one thing missing here is that the strength of gravity (magnitude of acceleration) is inversely proportional to distance. This means that the closer the object is to the mouse, the faster it accelerates.

</p>                                                                                                                                  


<div
class="note">
<h4
    style="text-align:right;">
    Exercise
    1.8
</h4>
<p>Try implementing the above example with a variable magnitude of acceleration, stronger when it is either closer or farther away.
</p>
</div>

<p>Let’s see what this example would look like with an array of movers (rather than just one).

<h3>The
    Ecosystem
    Project
</h3>
<p>As
    mentioned
    in
    the
    preface,
    one
    way
    to
    use
    this
    book
    is
    to
    build
    a
    single
    project
    over
    the
    course
    of
    reading
    it,
    incorporating
    elements
    from
    each
    chapter
    one
    step
    at
    a
    time.
    We’ll
    follow
    the
    development
    of
    an
    example
    project
    throughout
    this
    book—a
    simulation
    of
    an
    ecosystem.
    Imagine
    a
    population
    of
    computational
    creatures
    swimming
    around
    a
    digital
    pond,
    interacting
    with
    each
    other
    according
    to
    various
    rules.
    <p>
    </p>
    Step
    1
    Exercise:
    <p>
    </p>
    Develop
    a
    set
    of
    rules
    for
    simulating
    the
    real-world
    behavior
    of
    a
    creature,
    such
    as
    a
    nervous
    fly,
    swimming
    fish,
    hopping
    bunny,
    slithering
    snake,
    etc.
    Can
    you
    control
    the
    object’s
    motion
    by
    only
    manipulating
    the
    acceleration?
    Try
    to
    give
    the
    creature
    a
    personality
    through
    its
    behavior
    (rather
    than
    through
    its
    visual
    design).
